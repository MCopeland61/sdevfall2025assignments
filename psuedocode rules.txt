From my understanding, psuedocode doesn't have very strict rules but more like guidelines, some guidelines I found while trying to look the rules up were;

make your psuedocode easy to understand
write it in basic english (i.e. don't use keywords that don't really mean anything to someone unknowing)
have a definite start and end
use indentation as if it was a real program
make sure variables use the same case rules
